# KaedeBot
the source for the Kaede discord bot

# Adding her to your server
Use this link:

https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=213099188584579072&scope=bot&permissions=0

The more permissions you give her the better. Without them, some commands (like message deletion) won't work. Look at the developer pages for discord and give her what you are comfortable with!

# Use
As an admin, use command `!help` to see available commands. You can use `!help <command>` for command specific info.
